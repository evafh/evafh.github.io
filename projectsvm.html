            Indonesia's 2024 Presidential Candidates
            Using SVM</h2>
      </header>

      <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            The 2024 general election in Indonesia has become a hot topic on social media, especially on Twitter, 
            which has millions of active users. In this project, me and my Data Mining course teammates analyze 
            Twitter users' sentiments towards the presidential and vice-presidential candidates using the Support 
            Vector Machine (SVM) method. The aim of this research is to classify sentiments into positive, negative, 
            or neutral, thus providing insights into public perceptions of each candidate pair.

            <p class="timeline-text">
              Several issues were identified during data preprocessing, including irrelevant data (out of context), duplicate records, and entries with null values. 
              These problems occurred due to various factors, such as exploiters taking advantage of trending hashtags, Twitter buzzers generating noise, and usernames 
              that are identical to the candidates' names.
            </p>

            </div>

              To address these issues, the data was cleaned by removing irrelevant entries, eliminating duplicate records, and handling null values appropriately.

              As a result, the number of records for each candidate was reduced: 
              Candidate 01 from 1371 to 1286, Candidate 02 from 1403 to 1199, and 
              Candidate 03 from 1406 to 1286.

            <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Data Labelling</h4>
            <p class="timeline-text">
              The labeling process was performed on three sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral. 
              Three labeling methods were applied: manual labeling, using the VADER Lexicon tool, and utilizing a 
              model from Hugging Face. Below are the results:
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Candidate 01</h4>
            <div class="image-gallery1">
                <img src="./assets/images/label_1.png" alt="Deskripsi Gambar 1">
            </div>
            <p class="timeline-text">
              The labeling results for Candidate 01 show that both manual labeling and the VADER Lexicon indicate 
              predominantly positive sentiments, while the Hugging Face model reveals a significant amount of negative 
              sentiment.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Candidate 02</h4>
            <div class="image-gallery1">
                <img src="./assets/images/label_2.png" alt="Deskripsi Gambar 1">
            </div>
            <p class="timeline-text">
              For Candidate 02, the results indicate mostly negative sentiments with both manual labeling and the 
              Hugging Face model, whereas the VADER Lexicon shows a predominance of positive sentiment.
            </p>
            <h4 class="h4 timeline-item-title">Candidate 03</h4>
            <div class="image-gallery1">
                <img src="./assets/images/label_3.png" alt="Deskripsi Gambar 1">
            </div>
            <p class="timeline-text">
              As for Candidate 03, both manual labeling and the VADER Lexicon reflect mostly positive sentiments. 
              However, the Hugging Face model presents a more balanced distribution, with neutral sentiment being 
              slightly more prominent.
            </p>

            <br><p class="timeline-text">
              After exploring and comparing the three techniques, manual labeling was chosen.
              It was considered more effective because it allows for more accurate contextual understanding, 
              better handles ambiguity, offers flexibility and customization according to the specific needs of the 
              project, and produces higher-quality data.

              word appears in a document, while IDF reduces the weight of words that occur frequently across

            <p class="timeline-text">
              Modeling is performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM works by finding the optimal 
              hyperplane that separates data points from different classes with the largest possible margin. 
              It is effective for sentiment analysis because it performs well with high-dimensional data and 
              helps avoid overfitting, making it suitable for text classification tasks.

              After building the model, hyperparameter tuning is conducted. Hyperparameter tuning refers to
